The Hotel Management System is a web-based application developed using PHP and MySQL to simplify and automate hotel operations. The system provides a centralized platform for managing room details, customer records, bookings, and billing processes efficiently.
It allows the administrator to add and manage rooms, track room availability, handle customer reservations, and generate billing information. By replacing manual record-keeping with a digital solution, the system improves accuracy, reduces workload, and enhances overall operational efficiency.
